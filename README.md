# baidutieba-offenive-comment-mark

It's a course project, using bert model analysing baidutieba offenive comment with Tampermonkey to add tag for posts.

## Notice

Because of the anti-spider mechanism of the baidu, **the script cannot be used for a long time at same ip**.  
In other aspect, if model analysis is too slow, Tempermonkey will could not get response from server in time.
